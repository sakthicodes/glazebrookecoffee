            At Glaze Brooke, our coffee isn’t just grown on the land—it’s nurtured by the hands of our people. Every individual who works on our estate is a part of our extended family, with deep roots in the region. Generations of skilled local farmers, harvesters, and craftsmen bring their expertise, patience, and care to every step of the process, ensuring that our coffee embodies the essence of Yercaud.

            Beyond providing employment, we are committed to the well-being of our team. Fresh, nourishing meals are prepared daily for everyone working on the estate, fostering a sense of community and shared purpose. We believe that when people are cared for, they cultivate with heart, and that dedication is reflected in every bean we produce.
